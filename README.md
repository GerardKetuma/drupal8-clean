# Composer template for Drupal projects

Drupal 8 site setup with Wodby/Docker4Drupal and Docker-sync to speed up file transfers between host and containers since Docker for Mac is extremely slow. Also added PHPCS and automatic configuration for Drupal Coding standards.

Added Workspace specific configuration for Drupal to work with VS Code.
